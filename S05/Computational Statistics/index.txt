Cycle 1

1. Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
2. Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
3. Read a number in decimal and convert it into different bases.
4. Print the multiplication table of a given number. (use while loop)
5. Find nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
6. Read and display a sparse matrix using dictionary
7. Create a Python dictionary representing a student's grades in different subjects (e.g., Math, Science, History). Write a function to calculate the average grade of the student across all subjects.

8. Prime Numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence

Cycle 2

11. Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if: a. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets., b. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order. c. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
12. Define a tuple containing the names of different fruits. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a fruit name. If the entered fruit exists in the tuple, display a message confirming its presence; otherwise, display a message indicating its absence.
13. Count the number of vowels, consonants, words and question marks in a given string.
